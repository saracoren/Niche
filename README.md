I really enjoyed working on this task!

I spent the majority of my time on this project restructuring the HTML and adding CSS to get the desktop, mobile and hover styles matching as closely as possible to the Figma design. 

For the JavaScript portion, I used jQuery to allow the user to "heart" only one response for each question and also to allow the user to view "more" or "fewer" responses since the second question had 7 replies.
